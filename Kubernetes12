As kubectl understands by adding kind on cluster name, that this cluster was created by kind, so this is a kind cluster, but what is the actual name of the cluster? What should we speak ?
context is used for the cluster that is created by which type of tool, like kind? Is this context name  created by itself?

-----------------------------------------

You’ve spotted a very interesting detail 🔍 — let me explain step by step so it’s super clear:

---

## 🟢 What is the **actual name of the cluster**?

* When you create a Kind cluster (e.g. `kind create cluster --name tws-cluster`),
  *the real cluster name* inside Kubernetes is just `tws-cluster`.
* But in kubeconfig, Kind **adds a prefix `kind-`** to distinguish it.

  * So the context becomes `kind-tws-cluster`.
  * The cluster entry inside kubeconfig is also named `kind-tws-cluster`.

Example kubeconfig snippet 👇

```yaml
clusters:
- cluster:
    server: https://127.0.0.1:43773
  name: kind-tws-cluster    # ← cluster name stored in kubeconfig
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: kind-tws-cluster
    user: kind-tws-cluster
  name: kind-tws-cluster    # ← context name (same as cluster in Kind case)
```

---

## 🔵 What should we **call it when speaking**?

* The **real Kubernetes cluster** = `tws-cluster` (because that’s what you named it).
* But when using `kubectl`, you usually refer to it by the **context name** = `kind-tws-cluster`.
* So in conversation:

  * **Infra level (Kind tool):** “I created a Kind cluster named `tws-cluster`.”
  * **Kubectl level:** “I switched to the context `kind-tws-cluster`.”

---

## 🟣 Does **context tell us the tool (Kind, Minikube, EKS, GKE, etc.)?**

* ❌ No. Context itself does **not** indicate the tool.
* It just maps **Cluster + User + Namespace**.
* Example:

  * Minikube → creates a context called `minikube`.
  * Kind → creates contexts like `kind-<cluster-name>`.
  * EKS (AWS) → creates contexts like `arn:aws:eks:us-east-1:123456789:cluster/dev-cluster`.
* So the **tool chooses the naming convention**, but context is just a kubeconfig entry.

---

## 🟡 Who creates the context name?

* When you run `kind create cluster --name tws-cluster`,

  * Kind automatically **writes a kubeconfig entry**.
  * That entry’s cluster + context + user are all named `kind-tws-cluster`.
* You can rename the context if you want:

  ```bash
  kubectl config rename-context kind-tws-cluster dev-cluster
  kubectl config use-context dev-cluster
  ```

---

✅ **In summary:**

* **Actual cluster name (inside Kind):** `tws-cluster`.
* **Kubectl’s view (in kubeconfig):** `kind-tws-cluster` (context + cluster + user entry).
* **Context name = auto-created by the tool**, but you can rename it for clarity.
