What does the output of kubectl cluster-info mean when it shows the control plane and CoreDNS URLs?

### âœ… What does this output mean?

```
Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:32977
CoreDNS is running at https://127.0.0.1:32977/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy
```

1. **`Kubernetes control plane is running at https://127.0.0.1:32977`**

   * This means your **API Server (control plane)** is accessible on your local machine (`127.0.0.1`) at port `32977`.
   * Any command you run with `kubectl` will talk to this API server first.

2. **`CoreDNS is running at ... kube-dns:dns/proxy`**

   * This shows **CoreDNS service**, which is the clusterâ€™s **DNS system**.
   * It resolves pod/service names into IP addresses inside the cluster.
   * The long URL means CoreDNS can be reached via the API Server proxy, so you donâ€™t have to directly connect to worker nodes.

ðŸ‘‰ In short:

* The **control plane (API Server)** is your main entry point for managing the cluster.
* **CoreDNS** is a DNS service running inside the cluster to help pods/services find each other by name.

### ðŸ”„ Rewritten Question

Here are simpler versions of your question:

* **What does the output of `kubectl cluster-info` mean when it shows the control plane and CoreDNS URLs?**
* **Why does `kubectl cluster-info` show the control plane running at 127.0.0.1:32977 and CoreDNS at a proxy URL?**

Do you also want me to show you a **diagram-style explanation** (API Server â†’ CoreDNS â†’ Worker nodes) so you can remember this easily later?
