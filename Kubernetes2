## Can a pod have one or more containers?


A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, and it can contain:

One container â†’ (most common case, e.g., a backend service running in a single container).

Multiple containers â†’ but only when those containers are tightly coupled and need to share resources (like a sidecar container for logging, proxy, or monitoring).

ðŸ‘‰ Example:

A Pod with one Nginx container â†’ just serves web pages.

A Pod with two containers â†’

One container runs your app.

Another container runs a log shipper (sidecar).
Both share the same network (IP/port) and storage volumes.

So you can think:
Pod = wrapper around container(s) + shared network + shared storage.
